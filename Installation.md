## Requirements

This addon requires EmberJS `1.9` or above. If you want to use it with previous versions of EmberJS, you'll have to use a version of this addon prior to `0.0.14`.

EmberJS `1.9` or above is not the version of Ember installed by default with new applications when you use `ember new <app-name>` (as of `ember-cli` `0.1.5` and below). You can update Ember by running `bower install --save ember`. You can also find instructions on how to install Handlebars 2 [here](http://emberjs.com/blog/2014/12/08/ember-1-9-0-released.html#toc_handlebars-2-0), if required.


## Install the addon

To install the `ember-google-map` addon in your application, simply run

```bash
ember install:addon ember-google-map
```

from within your application folder.

If you have an old version of `ember-cli`, you'll get an error and will need to run this instead:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-google-map
```

### Author

My name is Huafu Gandon. I am a french dude who grew up in Paris, traveled around the World from 2009 to 2012 and then settled with my family in the middle of nowhere in the countryside of Isaan, a province of Thailand.

You can find my yet complete but existing website at [huafu.github.io](http://huafu.github.io).


### Contributors

For now only README issues and a little config addition have been contributed to, but I'd like to put the list of contributors here anyway. You can find this list [here](https://github.com/huafu/ember-google-map/graphs/contributors).

Thanks to everyone who reported issues and asked for features.  You have helped get this great add-on where it is at now, so I'd like to thank you too!

Also special thanks to [Oren Hizkiya](https://github.com/ohizkiya) who helps a lot keeping this wiki texts in better English than mine ;-)

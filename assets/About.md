### Author

My name is Huafu Gandon. I am a french dude who grew up in Paris, traveled around the World from 2009 to 2012 and since then is settled with my family in the middle of nowhere in the countryside of Isaan, a province of Thailand.

You can find my yet incomplete but existing website at [huafu.github.io](http://huafu.github.io).


### Contributors

For now only README issues and a little config addition have been contributed to, but I'd like to put the list of contributors here anyway. You can find this list [here](https://github.com/huafu/ember-google-map/graphs/contributors).

Also all of you who have reported issues and asked for features helped to get this great addon where it is at now, so I'd like to thank you too!
